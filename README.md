# Chrome Flow State

One of the biggest ways our focus is undermined on the internet is through [attention residue](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/06/a-productivity-lesson-from-a-classic-arcade-game/). Though small attention switches like checking your email might seem benign, it has a cost to doing good work! Unlike many focus extensions that block distracting websites, Flow State prioritizes _intentionality_ in web activities. Set an allowlist of websites you want to use, and everything else will be blocked until your timer is up.

## Getting started

To use this extension, clone the repo, install node modules, and compile:

```
npm i
npm run develop
```

Then open `chrome://extensions/` and load the extension in the `dist-dev` directory.
